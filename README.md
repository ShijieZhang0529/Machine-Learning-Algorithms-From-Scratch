# Machine learning algorithms from scratch
I implement a collectoin of machine learning algorithms from scratch. Use only Python numpy.

- Linear Regression (Gradient Descent, Normal Equation)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (Euclidean/Manhattan/Chebyshev distance, Cosine similarity etc.)
- Naive Bayes

This list is to be continued.
